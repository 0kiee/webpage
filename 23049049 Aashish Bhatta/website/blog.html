             <p>
            Technology refers to the application of scientific knowledge and tools to solve problems and improve human life. It encompasses a wide range of innovations, including computers, smartphones, the internet, artificial intelligence, robotics, and more. 
            Technology has revolutionized various aspects of human existence, from communication and transportation to healthcare and entertainment. It has made information readily accessible, allowing people to connect and communicate with one another across the globe.

              <h2 style="text-decoration:underline"> Positive Impact:-</h2>
            <p>
            Improved Communication: Technology has revolutionized communication, making it faster, easier, and more accessible. With the advent of smartphones, social media, and instant messaging apps, people can connect and communicate with others across the globe in real-time. This has strengthened personal relationships, facilitated business collaborations, and allowed for the sharing of information and ideas on a global scale.
             <br>
            Enhanced Efficiency and Productivity: Technology has greatly increased efficiency and productivity in various industries. Automation and computerization have streamlined processes, reduced human error, and accelerated tasks that would have taken much longer to complete manually. This has led to increased output, reduced costs, and improved overall performance.

          <h2 style="text-decoration:underline"> Negative Impact:-</h2>
          <p>
            Social Isolation: Increased reliance on technology for communication has led to decreased face-to-face interactions and social isolation. People may spend more time interacting with screens rather than engaging in meaningful, in-person relationships. This can lead to feelings of loneliness, depression, and a decline in overall well-being.
Privacy Concerns: The collection and use of personal data by technology companies raise concerns about privacy. With the proliferation of social media platforms and online services, individualsâ€™ personal information is often collected, analyzed, and used for targeted advertising or other purposes without their explicit consent. This raises questions about the ethical use of data and the need for robust privacy regulations.
